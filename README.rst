Overview
========

Signed kernel modules provide a mechanism for the kernel to verify the integrity of a module.
This provides the tools needed to build a kernel with support for signed modules.

 * All git tags are signed with arch@sapience.com key which is available via WKD
   or download from https://www.sapience.com/tech.

Latest Changes
--------------

 * If pyconcurrent module available use it's run_prog() else use local copy.
 * Tidy and Improve code:

    * PEP-8, PEP-257, PEP-484 PEP-561
    * Refactor

 * Add tests : run pytest in the *tests* directory.
   
   This will locate and use a kernel provided tool:
   /usr/lib/modules/xxx/build/scripts/sign-file

 * key and hash types are now read from the kernel config file. Keeps everything consistent.
 * Code re-org with supporing modules now moved to lib/xxx.py
 * Code works with hash type sha3-xxx (e.g. *sha3-512*) available in kernel 6.7 and openssl 3.2 or later.

Introduction

Kernel Modules
==============

The Linux kernel distinguishes and keeps separate the verification of modules from requiring or 
forcing modules to verify before allowing them to be loaded. Kernel modules fall into 2 classes:

Standard "in tree" modules which come with the kernel source code. They are compiled during the 
normal kernel build.

Out of tree modules which are not part of the kernel source distribution. They are built outside 
of the kernel tree, requiring the kernel headers package for each kernel they are to be built for. 
They can be built manually for a specific kernel and packaged, or they can be built whenever 
needed using DKMS `DKMS`_ 

Examples of such packages, provided by Arch, include:

  * Virtual gues modules `virtualbox-guest-modules-arch`_ 
    
During a standard kernel compilation, the kernel build tools create a private/public key pair and 
sign every in tree module (using the private key). The public key is saved in the kernel itself. 
When a module is subsequently loaded, the public key can then be used to verify that the module 
is unchanged.

The kernel can be enabled to always verify modules and report any failures to standard logs. 
The choice to permit the loading and use of a module which could not be verified can be either 
compiled into kernel or turned on at run time using a kernel parameter as explained 
in Arch Wiki Kernel Parameters `Arch Wiki Kernel Parameters`_.


How to sign kernel modules using a custom kernel  
================================================

The starting point is based on building a custom kernel package outlined in 
Kernel/Arch Build System `Kernel/Arch Build System`_,

We will adjust the build to:

  * Sign the standard in tree kernel modules
  * Provide what is needed to have signed out of tree modules and for the kernel to verify those modules.

Note: The goal is to have:

  * In tree modules signed during the standard kernel build process.

    The standard kernel build creates a fresh public/private key pair on each build.

  * Out of tree modules are signed and the associated public key is compiled in to the kernel.
    We will create a separate public/private key pair on each build.

Summary of what needs to be done 
================================

Each kernel build needs to made aware of the key/cert being used. Fresh keys are 
generated with each new kernel build.

A kernel config parameter is now used to make kernel aware of additional signing key::

  CONFIG_SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS="/path/to/oot-signing_keys.pem".

Keys and signing tools will be stored in current module build directory. Nothing needs to be done to 
clean this as removal is handled by the standard module cleanup. 

Certs are thus installed in ::

    /usr/lib/modules/<kernel-vers>-<build>/certs-local.  

####################
Kernel configuration  
####################

Kernel Config File
==================

CONFIG_SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS will be added automatically as explained below. 
In addition the following config options should be set by either manually editing the 
'config' file, or via make menuconfig in the linux 'src' area and subsequently copying 
the updated *.config* file back to the build file *config*.  
It is preferable to use elliptic curve type keys and zstd compression. 

  * CONFIG_MODULE_SIG=y

    Enable Loadable module suppot --->

    Module Signature Verification ->  activate

  * CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE=n

    Require modules to be validly signed -> leave off

    This allows the decision to enforce verified modules only as boot command line.
    If you are comfortable all is working then by all means change this to 'y'
    Command line version of this is : module.sig_enforce=1

  * CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_HASH=sha512

    Automatically sign all modules  -> activate
    Which hash algorithm    -> SHA-512

    kernel 6.7 and later support sha3 hashes. The preferred hash choice is then
    sha3-512. This also requires openssl version 3.2 or newer.


  * CONFIG_MODULE_COMPRESS_ZSTD=y

    Compress modules on installation -> activate
    Compression algorithm (ZSTD)

  * CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_KEY_TYPE_ECDSA=y

    Cryptographic API --->
    Certificates for Signature Checking --->
    Type of module signing key to be generated -> ECDSA

  * CONFIG_MODULE_ALLOW_MISSING_NAMESPACE_IMPORTS=n

    Enable Loadable module support --->
    Allow loading of modules with missing namespace imports -> set off 

Kernel command line 
===================

After you are comfortable things are working well you can enable the kernel parameter to 
require that the kernel only permit verified modules to be loaded:

.. code-block:: bash

    module.sig_enforce=1

############
Tools needed 
############

kernel build package 
====================

In the directory where the kernel package is built:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir certs-local

This directory will provide the tools to create the keys, as well as signing kernel modules.

  * Copy these files into certs-local directory:

.. code-block:: bash

        genkeys.py
        install-certs.py
        sign_module.py
        lib/*.py
        x509.oot.genkey

genkey.py & x509.oot.genkey
===========================

genkey.py along with its configuration file x509.oot.genkey are used to create key pairs.
It also provides the kernel with the key to sign out of tree modules by updating the config file 
used to build the kernel.

genkeys.py will create the key pairs in a directory named by date-time. It defaults to refreshing
the keys every 7 days but this can be changed with the *--refresh* command line option.

It also creates a soft link named 'current' which points to the newly created directory with the 'current' keys.
The actual key directory is named by date and time.

genkeys will check and update kernel configs given by the  --config config(s) option. This takes either a single
config file, or a shell glob for mulitple files. e.g. --config 'conf/config.*'. Remember to quote any wildcard 
characters to prevent the shell from expanding them. 
 
All configs will be updated with the same key. The default keytype and hash are taken from 
the kernel config (from CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_HASH and CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_KEY_TYPE_xxx) [1]_.

If multiple kernel configs are being used, all must use same key and hash types.

.. [1] In earlier versions these defaulted to elliptic curve and sha512 and could be set from
   the command line.

sign_module.py 
==============

signs out of tree kernel modules. It can be run manually but is typically invoked 
by dkms/kernel-sign.sh. It handles modules compressed with zstd, xz and gzip and depends on 
python-zstandard package to help with those compressed with zstd. 

install-certs.py
================

is called from the package_headers() function of PKGBUILD to install the signing keys. 
Example is given below. 
  
These files are all provided.

dkms support
================

**Important**

DKMS a mechanism for out-of-tree modules to be compiled against the kernel headers.
It is one thing to use signed modules provided in the kernel source but it is quite 
another to use modules, signed or not, that are out-of-tree. Any such module will
*taint* the kernel. See kernel docs `tainted_kernel`_ for more information.

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir certs-local/dkms

and add 2 files to the dkms dir:

.. code-block:: bash

        kernel-sign.conf
        kernel-sign.sh

These will be installed in /etc/dkms and provide a mechanism for dkms to automatically sign 
modules using the local key discussed above - this is the reccommended way to sign kernel modules. 
As explained, below - once this is installed - all that is needed to have dkms automatically 
sign modules is to make a soft link:

.. code-block:: bash

        cd /etc/dkms
        ln -s kernel-sign.conf <module-name>.conf

For example:
.. code-block:: bash

        ln -s kernel-sign.conf vboxdrv.conf

The link creation can easily be added to an arch package to simplify further if desired.

Modify PKGBUILD 
###############

What to change
==============

We need to make changes to kernel build as follows:

prepare()
=========

Add the following to the top of the prepare() function:

.. code-block:: bash

    prepare() {
     ...
        echo "Rebuilding local signing key..."
        # adjust cerdir as needed 
        certdir='../certs-local'
        $certdir/genkeys.py -v --config ../config --refresh 30d
      ... 
    }

The default key regeneration refresh period is 7 days, but this can be changed on the command line. 
If you want to create new keys monthly, then use "--refresh 30days" as an option to genekeys.py. 
You can refresh on every build by using "--refresh always". 
Refresh units can be seconds,minutes,hours,days or weeks. 

_package-headers() 
==================

  Add the following to the bottom of the _package-headers() function:

.. code-block:: bash

    _package-headers() {

    ...

    #
    # Out of Tree Module signing
    # This is run in the kernel source / build directory
    #
    echo "Local Signing certs for out of tree modules..."
      
    certs_local_src="../../certs-local" 
    certs_local_dst="${builddir}/certs-local"

    ${certs_local_src}/install-certs.py $certs_local_dst

    # install dkms tools if needed
    dkms_src="$certs_local_src/dkms"
    dkms_dst="${pkgdir}/etc/dkms"
    mkdir -p $dkms_dst

    rsync -a $dkms_src/{kernel-sign.conf,kernel-sign.sh} $dkms_dst/
    }

AUR Packages
============

There is an `Arch Sign Modules`_ package in the AUR along with
its companion github repo `Arch-SKM`_ which make use of `Kernel_Sign`_

arch-sign-modules reduces the manual steps for building a fully signed custom 
kernel to 3 commands to *Update*, *Build* and *Install* a kernel.

.. code-block:: bash

        abk -u kernel-name
        abk -b kernel-name
        abk -i kernel-name
